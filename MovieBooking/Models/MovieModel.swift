var synopsis = "Late May 1940. Already eight months into World War II, Adolf Hitler's formidable army sweeps into Belgium, and then, France is next. As a result, the outnumbered Allied Forces collapse under the sheer volume of the invader, and 400,000 troops find themselves with their backs to the cold North Sea, stranded on the sandy shores of the French coastal town of Dunkirk. Now, with the relentless German Luftwaffe hammering the beach, and with the distance between England and continental Europe just 33.3 kilometres across the Strait of Dover, the massive evacuation operation code-named Operation Dynamo commences, involving hundreds of naval and civilian vessels. As three Royal Air Force Spitfires try to fend off the Nazi attacks and buy some time, the grizzled civilian captain, Mr Dawson, his son, Peter, and his friend, George, struggle to rescue as many soldiers as they can, in a desperate operation that will serve as a pivotal point for the war effort, and become known as the \"Miracle of Dunkirk\"."
